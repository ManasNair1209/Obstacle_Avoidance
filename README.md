# Obstacle_Avoidance
Welcome to Omni-World
I have tried to incorporate my basic fundamentals of AI, and using that built a small user defined grid based environment
User can chose where to keep obstacles, whether they want them to be statc or dynamic. 
Post this, they can choose between Astar and Dijistra algorithms to find the shortest route between the source and goal nodes. 

The project is still under development with the future aspects including:
1) Real time obstacle detection
2) Implementing the concept of potential fields
3) Converting it to a hardware project.
